# BCN_AIRE

We analyze the $NO_2$ and $PM_{10}$ concentration registers collected by an atmospheric pollution measure station at the Eixample neighborhood in Barcelona, Spain. We evaluate the level of short exposure to those pollutants between June 2019 and July 2022 according to the Air Quality Guidelines established by the World Health Organization. By means of an Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method we construct a one step forecast time series model to predict the $NO_2$ and $PM_{10}$ daily mean concentration levels.
